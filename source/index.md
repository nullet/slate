# For Developers

## Extend the platform (or build your own).

We also have services for Single Sign-On (SSO) and LDAP integration.

Our REST API allows you to replicate much of the functionality in our hosted marketplace solution to build custom widgets and stock tickers for your Intranet, create custom reports, add trading capabilities to an existing application, or even develop your own custom marketplace.

To start developing with the API you can use any language you're comfortable with such as PHP, Java, .NET, Ruby, or Python. You just need to create a site for your new applications to interact with.
